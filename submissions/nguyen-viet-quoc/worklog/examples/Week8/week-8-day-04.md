## üöß Kh√≥ khƒÉn v√† gi·∫£i ph√°p

### V·∫•n ƒë·ªÅ 1: DNS Propagation Delay
- **M√¥ t·∫£**: DNS changes took longer than expected to propagate globally
- **Impact**: Some users experienced temporary access issues
- **Root Cause**: DNS TTL settings were too high
- **Solution**: 
  - Lower DNS TTL before deployment
  - Use multiple DNS providers cho redundancy
  - Implement health checks v·ªõi automatic failover
  - Communicate v·ªõi users about potential temporary issues
- **Result**: Smooth transition v·ªõi minimal user impact
- **Lesson**: DNS planning crucial cho production deployments

### V·∫•n ƒë·ªÅ 2: Monitoring Alert Noise
- **M√¥ t·∫£**: Too many false positive alerts generated initially
- **Impact**: Alert fatigue v√† potential to miss real issues
- **Root Cause**: Alert thresholds set too aggressively
- **Solution**: 
  - Fine-tune alert thresholds based on baseline data
  - Implement alert correlation v√† grouping
  - Use different severity levels cho different types of alerts
  - Regular review v√† adjustment of alert rules
- **Result**: Meaningful alerts v·ªõi reduced noise
