# Proposal: Backup và Archive Migration với Tiered Storage
1. 📄 Executive Summary
## 🧩 Problem Statement
## In the era of data explosion, organizations face increasing costs for storing 	large volumes of unstructured data, especially backups and archives. 	Traditional backup systems are often static, expensive, and lack 	automation in data retrieval and compliance enforcement.
## 💡 Solution Overview
## This proposal introduces a cloud-native backup system leveraging AWS 	S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically transition backup data based on 	access frequency. The system integrates Object Lock for compliance, 	Glacier tiers for low-cost archival, and monitoring tools for retrieval 	automation and cost control.
## 📈 Business Benefits & ROI
## Up to 70% storage cost savings via automatic tiering.
## Regulatory compliance with Object Lock and retention policies.
## Improved operational efficiency with automation and monitoring.
## Scalable and secure data storage without infrastructure overhead.
## 💰 Investment & Timeline
## Estimated cloud infrastructure budget: $150/month.
## Development time: 6 weeks.
## Break-even point expected within 5 months.
## 🎯 Success Metrics
## 60%+ data moved to cold storage tiers within 90 days.
## 99.99% availability and durability.
## Zero incidents of unauthorized deletions.
## 30% reduction in backup-related operational effort.
## 🧪 Evaluation Criteria
## Clarity and conciseness: Clearly summarizes the proposal's core value without unnecessary complexity.
## Compelling business case: Demonstrates a clear return on investment and operational impact.
## Accurate summary of main points: Covers all critical aspects from problem to expected outcomes.
## Executive-level language: Uses professional and concise language suitable for leadership audiences.

2. Problem Statement
Current Situation
## Most on-premise or legacy cloud backup systems store all data at the 	same tier regardless of access patterns, leading to high costs. Additionally, 	ensuring data immutability and compliance involves complex manual 	policies.
Pain Points
## Rising storage costs (especially for infrequently accessed data).
## Manual management of backup lifecycles.
## Compliance risks from accidental deletions.
## Lack of centralized cost monitoring and alerts.
Stakeholders Affected
## IT Operations Team: burdened by manual lifecycle management.
## Compliance Officers: need proof of data integrity.
## Finance: affected by unpredictable storage costs.
Business Consequences
## Without optimization, backup costs could rise 35-50% YoY. A breach in 	compliance or loss of critical backups can lead to financial penalties or 	data recovery failure.
Market Opportunity
## With AWS offering built-in lifecycle automation, this system can serve 	SMEs and regulated industries (e.g., fintech, healthcare) seeking secure, 	cost-optimized backups.
3. Solution Architecture
### 🗺️ High-Level Architecture Diagram
(Included in Appendix A)
AWS Services Selected
## Amazon S3 with Intelligent-Tiering: Automated storage class transitions.
## S3 Object Lock: Enforces retention for compliance.
## S3 Glacier & Glacier Deep Archive: Cost-effective cold storage.
## AWS CloudWatch: Logs and monitors access patterns.
## AWS Cost Explorer: Tracks and forecasts storage spending.
Component Interactions
## Uploaded data goes to S3 > Monitored by CloudWatch > Access frequency triggers class transitions > Object Lock protects data > Glacier retrieval initiated if cold files are accessed.
Security & Compliance
## IAM Policies: Restrict delete/modify actions.
## Object Lock: Enables WORM (Write Once Read Many).
## Encryption: S3 Default SSE enabled (AES-256).
## Bucket Policies: Allow access only from specific roles/accounts.
Scalability & Performance
## Automatically scales with storage demand.
## Retrieval from Glacier optimized for batch requests.
Integration Points
## Existing on-premise systems can use AWS CLI or SDKs for integration.
## Third-party backup tools (e.g., Veeam, Commvault) can push backups to S3.
4. Technical Implementation
Implementation Phases
## Setup AWS Environment: IAM roles, billing alerts, bucket policies.
## Create S3 Buckets: Enable Intelligent-Tiering, Object Lock.
## Upload Backups: Import historical backups or schedule uploads.
## Access Simulation: Generate realistic traffic to validate tiering.
## Monitoring Setup: CloudWatch, S3 Analytics, Cost Explorer.
## Testing: Perform retrieval from Glacier, delete protection check.
## Optimization: Adjust retention periods, enable Deep Archive.
Technical Requirements
## Compute: AWS Lambda (for automation scripts, optional).
## Storage: S3 Intelligent-Tiering with ~1 TB monthly usage.
## Network: Secure endpoints via VPC or Gateway Endpoints.
Development Methodologies
## Infrastructure-as-Code: Use CloudFormation or Terraform.
## CI/CD (Optional): GitHub Actions for automation deployments.
Testing Strategy
## Unit: Validate script logic.
## Integration: Ensure tier transition works.
## Performance: Simulate access spikes.
## Compliance: Try unauthorized deletions (should fail).
Deployment & Rollback
## Phased rollout per bucket/project.
## Restore previous backup via S3 Versioning or Glacier Restore.
Configuration Management
## Use AWS Config for compliance rules.
## Maintain version-controlled config files in repository.
5. Timeline & Milestones
## Dependencies: Account provisioning, billing permissions.
Buffer Time: +1 week for AWS approval delays or script bugs.
6. Budget Estimation
Monthly AWS Costs
S3 Intelligent-Tiering (1 TB): ~$20
Glacier & Deep Archive storage: ~$4 (est. 200 GB cold)
PUT/GET requests: ~$10
CloudWatch Metrics: ~$8
Cost Explorer: Free
One-time Development Costs
Engineer Time: 40 hours @ $30/hr = $1,200
Total 1st Year Cost
Monthly Infra: ~$42 × 12 = $504
One-time Dev: $1,200
Total: $1,704
ROI & Optimization
Previous static S3 storage: ~$100/month × 12 = $1,200
Estimated savings = $696/year (58%)
Break-even in 4-5 months
## Use lifecycle policies & monitoring to further reduce costs.
7. Risk Assessment
## Monitoring: Weekly checks via CloudWatch, AWS Config.
Escalation: Alert stakeholders via SNS + email for anomalies.
