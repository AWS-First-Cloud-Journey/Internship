## üöß KH√öNG KHƒÇN V√Ä TH√ÅCH TH·ª®C

### üî¥ Major Challenges

#### 1. Container Technology Learning Curve
- **V·∫•n ƒë·ªÅ**: Docker v√† containerization concepts completely new
- **Impact**: 6+ hours spent on basic concepts
- **Root Causes**:
  - No prior container experience
  - Complex ecosystem (Docker, registries, orchestration)
  - Different deployment paradigm
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Systematic tutorial following
  - Hands-on practice v·ªõi simple applications
  - Focus on practical usage over theory
- **Lessons Learned**:
  - Containers solve real deployment problems
  - Start simple, gradually increase complexity
  - Practice is essential for retention

#### 2. NoSQL Data Modeling Paradigm Shift
- **V·∫•n ƒë·ªÅ**: DynamoDB data modeling completely different from SQL
- **Impact**: Multiple table redesigns, 4+ hours lost
- **Root Causes**:
  - SQL mindset deeply ingrained
  - Kh√¥ng hi·ªÉu access patterns importance
  - Unfamiliar v·ªõi NoSQL best practices
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Study DynamoDB design patterns extensively
  - Practice v·ªõi different use cases
  - Use NoSQL Workbench for visualization
- **Lessons Learned**:
  - NoSQL requires different thinking approach
  - Access patterns drive design decisions
  - Single-table design is powerful but complex

#### 3. Monitoring Threshold Optimization
- **V·∫•n ƒë·ªÅ**: Setting appropriate CloudWatch alarm thresholds
- **Impact**: Too many false positives, alert fatigue
- **Root Causes**:
  - No baseline metrics available
  - Kh√¥ng hi·ªÉu normal system behavior
  - Overly sensitive initial settings
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Establish baseline over 24-48 hours
  - Gradual threshold adjustment
  - Use percentile-based thresholds
- **Lessons Learned**:
  - Monitoring requires patience v√† iteration
  - Baseline establishment is crucial
  - Alert quality more important than quantity

### üü° Minor Challenges

#### 1. DNS Propagation Understanding
- **Issue**: DNS changes taking time to propagate
- **Solution**: Learn about TTL settings v√† global propagation
- **Lesson**: DNS changes require patience

#### 2. CLI Script Error Handling
- **Issue**: Scripts failing silently
- **Solution**: Implement proper error checking v√† logging
- **Lesson**: Robust scripting practices essential

#### 3. Auto Scaling Configuration Complexity
- **Issue**: Many configuration options overwhelming
- **Solution**: Start v·ªõi simple policies, gradually add complexity
- **Lesson**: Incremental approach works best
